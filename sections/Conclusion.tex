\section{Conclusion}
By now the technology of diamond detectors is well established in high energy physics. Many of the experiments are already using \acp{BCM} or \acp{BLM} based on \ac{CVD} diamonds.\par
In extensive studies it was found that irradiated \ac{pCVD} diamond detectors work reliably and show no signal dependence to the \orderof{\SI{2}{\%}} up to an incident particle flux of \SI{20}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2}. This was also shown for an irradiation  up to a fluence of \SI{4e15}{\ncm}.\par
There is also great progress in the development of more radiation tolerant devices. The working principle of both 3D strip and pixel detectors was proven with great success down to cell sizes of \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter}. For the first time more than \SI{80}{\%} of the created charge in the material was read out. The efficiency of the column drilling process is now above \SI{99}{\%} and the relative efficiency of the 3D pixel detectors is \SI{99.3}{\%} compared to a silicon detector.
