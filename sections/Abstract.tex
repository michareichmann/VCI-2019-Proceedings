\begin{abstract}
The latest test beam results of 3D detectors fabricated with poly-crystalline Chemical Vapor Deposition (pCVD) diamonds will be shown. The devices have \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter} cells with columns \SI{2.6}{\micro\meter} in diameter. In one of the devices the cells were ganged in a \SI{3x2}{} cell pattern and in the other the cells were ganged in a \SI{5x1}{} cell pattern to match the layouts of the pixel read-out chips currently used in the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the LHC, respectively. In beam tests, using tracks reconstructed with a high precision tracking telescope, both devices achieved tracking efficiencies greater than \SI{97}{\%}. In the same beam tests, the first pulse height distributions from pCVD diamond 3D pixel devices were measured and will be presented. Finally, the latest test beam results of irradiated poly-crystalline CVD diamond pad and pixel detectors will be presented.
