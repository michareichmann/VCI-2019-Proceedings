\section*{Acknowledgements} 
We want to thank the laser drilling team in Oxford around Patrick Salter for providing us with these great 3D detectors. Furthermore we want to thank Bert Harrop in Princeton and the team at IFAE for the great efforts in bump bonding our devices. Finally I also want to thank the rest of my collaboration for the advise and good cooperation.
